# Airflow chart
Helm chart for deploying Apache Airflow on kubernetes
Read more about Kubernetes Executor and Operator [here](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/kubernetes.html).

## Guideance
To force you not to end up in performance and/or other issues, this template takes some experience into account.

### Chain of configuration
The chart might seem to have secrets and configmaps that isnÂ´t used, and worker pods might seem to be missing mounts.
The configuration design of airflow is not straight forward. Webservers and scheduler gets config overloaded with a
configmap while a secret populate the configration file, that in turn creates environment variables for the workers(tasks).
All of which is configurable from the values file.

The chart automatically sets the following variables:
AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN,
AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES__AIRFLOW_CONFIGMAP,
AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES__NAMESPACE
and:
AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES__WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
if rbac is enabled.

### Database backend
If you want your own DB backend for Airflow, just disable postgresql in the values file and add the sqlAlchemyConn
value in the values file:
```
sqlAlchemyConn: postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@db-hostname:5432/schema
```

### Provision connections
As the DB needs to be at least initialized, but also connections has to be provisioned to Ariflow. There is a provision
job for this. See the provisioner section of the values file for some inspiration.

### Provision dags
Inner workings of airflow seems to work best if you do not share a volume for dags, but rather put your materialized dags
as a layer on your docker image. Not hosting files on a remote filesystem also improves performance a small bit.
It might seem cumbersome to rebuild your docker image each time and you might have dags in many different repos with
different pipelines. I am sorry, the most reliable way is to do it like this.

### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-airflow` in the `my-airflow` namespace:

```
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
$ helm upgrade --install my-airflow --namespace=my-airflow incubator/airflow
```

This chart includes a postgresql chart as a dependency to the Airflow cluster in its `requirement.yaml` by default. 
The chart can be customized using the following configurable parameters:

Specify parameters using `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`

Alternatively a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided like this:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-airflow -f values.yaml incubator/airflow
```
